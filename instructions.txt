Gesture-Based Fully Interactive 3D Solar System in Three.js

Build a real-time, browser-based, fully interactive 3D solar system using Three.js with camera-based hand tracking; the experience must combine accurate visualization, intuitive gesture control, and educational planetary information in a single seamless interface.

Primary Interaction Model via Hand Gestures
Implement three core gesture modes with clear detection thresholds and visual feedback;

Pinch gesture must control zoom by physically moving the camera closer to or farther from the scene, not by changing field of view; zoom speed must scale smoothly with pinch distance;

Closed palm movement must pan the camera horizontally and vertically across the solar system while maintaining a consistent viewing height;

Open rotating palm must rotate the entire solar system around its central axis or orbit the camera around a selected planet depending on context; the system must only switch to rotation when palm openness confidence exceeds a defined threshold to avoid accidental mode changes.

Gesture Reliability and Fail-Safes
If hand tracking confidence drops, the system must automatically fall back to mouse and keyboard controls without breaking the experience; a subtle on-screen indicator must inform users when tracking is weak; users must be able to recalibrate hand tracking with one button.

Solar System Simulation and Structure
Model the Sun, all eight major planets, major moons, and the asteroid belt with visible orbital paths; planets must rotate on their axes while orbiting the Sun at visually accurate relative speeds; distances must be scaled down proportionally to fit within an explorable scene while preserving spatial relationships; a toggle must allow users to switch between realistic scale and educational scale.

Planet Selection and Focus System
Users must be able to select a planet through either pointer aiming plus one-second dwell or pinch while looking at a planet; once selected, the camera must smoothly center on that planet; all other motion in the system must slow down in focus mode to reduce distraction; users must be able to exit focus mode with a simple open-hand wave.

Dynamic Planetary Information Panel
When a planet is selected, an information panel must appear displaying; planet name; diameter; distance from the Sun; orbital period; rotation period; number of moons; atmospheric composition; average surface temperature; and one visual diagram of orbit; the panel must update automatically when the user selects a new body.

Visual Fidelity and Environment
Use high-resolution planetary textures, realistic lighting from the Sun, dynamic shadows, volumetric solar glow, and a deep-space starfield background; include three visualization presets; Realistic Mode; Educational Mode with labeled orbits; Artistic Mode with stylized colors and glow.

Customization Controls
Provide a side control panel where users can adjust; background space color; star brightness; solar flare intensity; planetary atmosphere hue; toggle orbital lines; toggle labels; toggle scale markers.

Performance Requirements
The system must run at a stable 60 FPS on standard laptops with webcams; gesture latency must remain under 150 milliseconds; planet selection accuracy must work within two attempts; textures and particles must be optimized to avoid frame drops.

Accessibility and Alternative Controls
Every gesture action must have a mouse, keyboard, and touch equivalent; arrow keys for panning; scroll wheel for zoom; click-and-drag for rotation; this ensures usability without a camera.

User Onboarding
On first launch, present a 30-second guided tutorial that visually demonstrates pinch zoom, closed-palm pan, and open-palm rotation; users must be able to skip the tutorial.

Privacy Guarantee
All hand tracking must occur locally in the browser; no video or biometric data may be stored or transmitted; display a clear notice confirming local processing.

Technical Stack Suggestion
Use Three.js for rendering; Mediapipe Hands or WebXR Hand Tracking for gesture recognition; lightweight orbital simulation instead of full N-body physics; optimized texture loading with lazy loading for distant planets.
